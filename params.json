{"name":"Allowance","body":"# Allowance\r\n\r\n**Allowance is a general-use permission management library for Ruby.\r\nIt's decidedly simple, highly flexible, and has out-of-the-box support\r\nfor ActiveModel-compliant classes.**\r\n\r\nIt was inspired by Ryan Bates' fantastic Rails authorization plugin [cancan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan) and, unlike most other gems\r\nof its kind, is not bound to a specific framework.\r\n\r\nA simple Example:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np = Allowance.define do |can|\r\n  # Allow logging in\r\n  can.login!\r\n\r\n  # Allow creating new Article instances\r\n  can.create! Article\r\n\r\n  # Allow the user to edit Article instances that belong to him\r\n  can.edit! Article, :author_id => current_user.id\r\n\r\n  # Allow viewing all Article instances that are published or the user's\r\n  can.read! Article, ['published = ? OR author_id = ?', true, current_user.id]\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAllowance parses these permission definitions and stores them in the object the\r\n`Allowance.define` call returns. It is now up to you to query that object where\r\nnecessary. Some examples:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np.login?            # true\r\np.create? Article   # true\r\np.read? @article    # true or false, depending on state of @article\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use the same object to provide you with correctly scoped models, too:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np.scoped_model(:view, Article).all\r\n# -> Article.where(['published = ? OR author_id = ?', true, current_user.id]).all\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nAllowance should work fine with Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3 and respective JRuby versions. Please consult Allowance's [Travis status page](http://travis-ci.org/hmans/allowance) for details.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hmans/allowance.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hmans/allowance)\r\n\r\n### Installing through Bundler\r\n\r\nWell, you've done this before, haven't you? Just add the `allowance` gem to your project's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\ngem 'allowance'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installing without Bundler\r\n\r\nInstall using RubyGems:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install allowance\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen require it in your code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequire 'rubygems'\r\nrequire 'allowance'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Defining permissions\r\n\r\nUse `Allowance.define` to create a new permissions object, then use its `allow!` or `can!`\r\nmethods to add permissions:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np = Allowance.define\r\np.allow! :sing\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of using `allow!` or `can!`, you can just name the permission directly:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np.sing!\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also specify permissions as a block:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np = Allowance.define do |allow|\r\n  allow.sing!\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Querying permissions\r\n\r\nSimilar to how you define permissions, you can use the `allowed?` or `can?` methods, or\r\nquery permissions directly by name. The following two lines are equivalent:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np.allowed? :sing\r\np.can? :sing\r\np.sing?\r\n```\r\n\r\n### One-dimensional permissions\r\n\r\nAllowance lets you define simple, one-dimenstional permissions like this:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np = Allowance.define do |allow|\r\n  allow.sing!\r\n  allow.play!\r\n  allow.dance! if current_user.can_dance?\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Two-dimensional permissions\r\n\r\nMost of the time, you will be using two-dimensional permissions, consisting of a\r\n_verb_ and an _object_, with the object typically being some kind of model class.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np = Allowance.define do |allow|\r\n  allow.view! Article\r\n\r\n  if current_user.is_admin?\r\n    allow.edit! Article\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen querying for permissions, just pass an object as an additional parameter:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np.edit? Article\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you pass a class instance (instead of a class), Allowance will check for\r\nthe permission defined for its class, so the following will work, too:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np.edit? @article\r\n```\r\n\r\nAllowance will even allow you to define permissions in specific objects -- this is not recommended, though, since permission objects defined through Allowance only exist in memory; if you need to control permissions on individual model objects, you'll be better off with another authorization library, ideally one that stores its permissions in your datastore.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Defining model scopes\r\n\r\nFor classes implementing ActiveModel (eg. ActiveRecord, Mongoid and others), Allowance allows you to restrict certain permissions to specific scopes. For example, if, in  a web application, a user should only be able to see articles that have been published, but admin users can see everything, you can define the permissions like this:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np = Allowance.define do |allow|\r\n  allow.view! Article, :published => true\r\n\r\n  if current_user.is_admin?\r\n    allow.view! Article\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see here that when a specific permission (for a _verb_ and _object_ combination) is defined more than once, the last definition will overwrite all those that came before it.\r\n\r\nIn the example above, we defined the scope as a so-called \"where conditions hash\", ie. a hash passed to the model class' `.where` method. Since the hash notation assumes a logical AND and isn't all that flexible overall, you can also use the same string/array syntax you know from ActiveModel:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np.view! Article, ['published = ? OR user_id = ?', true, current_user.id]\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, you're encouraged to re-use scopes defined on the model class. Just define your scope using a lambda:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\np.view! Article, lambda { |r| r.viewable_by(current_user) }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Defining contextual permissions\r\n\r\nSince permissions are just Ruby code, you can use all your favorite language\r\nconstructs when defining permissions. For example, in a web application\r\nproviding a `current_user` method, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\npermissions = Allowance.define do |allow|\r\n  allow.read! Article\r\n\r\n  if current_user.is_admin?\r\n    allow.destroy! Article\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then query this permission like you'd expect:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\n@article = Article.find(params[:id])\r\nif permissions.destroy? @article\r\n  @article.destroy\r\nelse\r\n  raise \"You're not allowed to do this\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to seeing your Pull Requests. However, please be aware that,\r\nlike with pretty much all other projects I'm maintaining, I'm trying to keep it\r\nas small as possible, so I'm going to be somewhat picky about which pull\r\nrequests to accept. If you're adding new features, I recommed you check back\r\nwith me first in order to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Hendrik Mans <hendrik@mans.de>\r\n\r\nMIT License\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
